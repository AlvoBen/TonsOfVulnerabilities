/* 
The SettingData class represents configuration-related and operational parameters for one or more ManagedElement(s). A ManagedElement may have multiple SettingData objects associated with it. The current operational values for an Element's parameters are reflected by properties in the Element itself or by properties in its associations. These properties do not have to be the same values present in the SettingData object. For example, a modem may have a SettingData baud rate of 56Kb/sec but be operating at 19.2Kb/sec. 
Note that the CIM_SettingData class is very similar to CIM_Setting, yet both classes are present in the model. This is because many implementations have successfully used CIM_Setting. However, issues have arisen that could not be resolved without defining a new class. Therefore, until a new major release occurs, both classes will exist in the model. Refer to the Core White Paper for additional information.

/*
Within the scope of the instantiating Namespace, InstanceID opaquely and uniquely identifies an instance of this class. In order to ensure uniqueness within the NameSpace, the value of InstanceID SHOULD be constructed using the following 'preferred' algorithm: 
<OrgID>:<LocalID> 
Where <OrgID> and <LocalID> are separated by a colon ':', and where <OrgID> MUST include a copyrighted, trademarked or otherwise unique name that is owned by the business entity creating/defining the InstanceID, or is a registered ID that is assigned to the business entity by a recognized global authority (This is similar to the <Schema Name>_<Class Name> structure of Schema class names.) In addition, to ensure uniqueness <OrgID> MUST NOT contain a colon (':'). When using this algorithm, the first colon to appear in InstanceID MUST appear between <OrgID> and <LocalID>. 
<LocalID> is chosen by the business entity and SHOULD not be re-used to identify different underlying (real-world) elements. If the above 'preferred' algorithm is not used, the defining entity MUST assure that the resultant InstanceID is not re-used across any InstanceIDs produced by this or other providers for this instance's NameSpace. 
For DMTF defined instances, the 'preferred' algorithm MUST be used with the <OrgID> set to 'CIM'.
